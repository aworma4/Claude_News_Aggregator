# Evidence House Hackathon AI Code
A basic streamlit app that uses Claude AI API calls to submit engineered prompts and return the results.
The intention was to provide rapid information on various news topics as follows:
  * A webscraping layer that takes a sample of article from the web (this can be a balanced sample, this could be a weighted sample or it could simply be the top N results for that given topic)
  * Summarises + performs sentiment analysis on these articles.
  * Generates typical tweets/press releases to this evetn
  * Pulls in relevant gov.uk articles and compares these to the news for differences in information

The code itself is very basic and poorly written - it was written in about 5 hour.
