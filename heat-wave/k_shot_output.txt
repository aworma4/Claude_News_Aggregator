Here is the sentiment analysis for the requested aspect:
(Cases of dengue fever could reach record highs this year, partly due to global warming benefiting mosquitoes that spread it., -0.6, The aspect expresses concern that cases of dengue fever could reach near record levels this year, which is attributed in part to global warming helping mosquitoes spread the disease. While not overtly negative, the sentiment suggests rising cases are a bad thing. I gave it a moderately negative score of -0.6 due to the worry over high case numbers, but it does not express extreme negativity.)
